# Partnerships — Clinics, Shelters, Sponsors (Draft)

## Who our partners are
- **Clinics:** treat animals and receive payouts; provide verification signals.
- **Shelters / rescue orgs:** post cases/campaigns, provide updates, manage adoptions.
- **Sponsors (CSR / brands):** fund matching drives, sponsor campaigns, or underwrite operating costs.

## Guiding principles
- **Clinics are beneficiaries, not customers.** Keep workflows lightweight and respectful.
- **Verification beats “marketing”.** Trust and proof are the product.
- **Partner success is donor trust.** Better updates and transparency drive donations.

## Clinic partnership model (recommended)
### What clinics get
- Verified case intake channel (fewer ambiguous cases).
- Clear payout workflow (transparency + audit trail).
- Visibility as a trusted partner clinic.

### What we ask from clinics
- Basic verification steps (confirm intake / provide invoice or treatment notes).
- Timely updates for donor transparency.

### What we do *not* do (early)
- No subscription “plans” billed to clinics as a primary monetization lever.
- No pressure to market or upsell.

## Shelter / rescue partnerships
- Verification tiers (identity verification + track record).
- Featured partner profiles (non-paywalled at first; focus on trust).
- Tools: recurring supporters, analytics, and content assistance (optional later).

## Sponsor partnerships (CSR)
- Sponsorship formats:
  - matching donations (time-boxed drives)
  - “sponsor a city” or “sponsor a clinic network”
  - underwrite platform operations (moderation, verification)
- Guardrails:
  - transparent labeling
  - no sponsor influence on medical decisions
  - strict brand safety and conflict policy

## Open questions
- Verification requirements that are realistic for clinics (what’s too heavy?).
- Payout flow: hold funds until verification vs partial advance.
- Sponsor policy: which categories are allowed / disallowed.
