# Pawtreon — Vision (1 page)

> **Last updated:** 2026-01-23  
> **Canonical name:** Pawtreon

## What we’re building
Pawtreon is a **trust-first rescue fundraising network** that makes “see an animal → help happens” fast and reliable.

It combines:
- **Instagram-like discovery** (feed + activity that feels alive)
- **Patreon-like support** (recurring help for trusted rescuers/clinics)
- **Verification + transparency** (proof and updates as first-class product)

## Why now
Rescue coordination lives on Facebook/Instagram today, but:
- urgent posts get buried,
- scams spread easily,
- donors don’t get reliable outcomes.

Pawtreon makes rescue cases trackable, verifiable, and shareable as a single system of record.

## The wedge
Start with **emergency cases** (high urgency, clear need, strong donor intent):
1) a finder/rescuer creates a case quickly,
2) partners/clinics verify and post updates,
3) donors fund with confidence,
4) outcomes are visible and build trust loops.

## Product pillars
1. **Trust & safety**
   - verification ladder (unverified → community verified → clinic verified)
   - evidence attachments + external source attribution
   - reporting + moderation queue
2. **Speed**
   - mobile-first creation
   - AI-assisted drafts (human-in-loop)
3. **Transparency**
   - updates timeline
   - receipts/proof where possible
4. **Social consolidation**
   - link cards/embeds as input
   - “import into Pawtreon” as the durable long-term path
5. **Native-quality UX**
   - Vite + Capacitor today → native affordances (camera, share sheet, push)

## What “good” looks like (North Star)
- A rescuer can create a credible case in minutes.
- A donor can decide and donate in seconds, and keep following updates.
- Verified partners/clinics make trust scalable.

## What we will not do yet
Moonshots like drones/maps are optional future experiments; we ship **trust + payments + verification + updates** first.
