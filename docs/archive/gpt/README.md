# GPT audit artifacts (archived)

> These files are reference-only and do not override the repo’s canonical docs at the repo root.

## Start here (canonical docs)
- [`docs/README.md`](../../README.md) — source of truth for execution + product docs

## Start here (audit context)
- **Latest:** [`audit-2026-01-23.md`](./audit-2026-01-23.md) — current full-repo audit (security + Tailwind lane + execution notes)
- Historical: [`gpt_xhigh.md`](./gpt_xhigh.md) — older executive summary (may not match current repo state)

## What’s here
- [`audit-2026-01-23.md`](./audit-2026-01-23.md) — current full-repo audit (supersedes older notes where they conflict)
- [`tailwind-phase1-audit.md`](./tailwind-phase1-audit.md) — Tailwind v4 + shadcn token/theme audit (Phase 1 format)
- [`checks-run.md`](./checks-run.md) — results of lint/typecheck/build gates run during audit
- [`audit-codebase.md`](./audit-codebase.md) — detailed repo audit (frontend/backend/tooling/security/perf)
- [`audit-docs.md`](./audit-docs.md) — audit of existing `docs/` with mismatches and recommended fixes
- [`tech-stack-audit.md`](./tech-stack-audit.md) — dependency/stack review and recommended adds/removes
- [`repo-organization.md`](./repo-organization.md) — minimal structure + dev practices recommendations

## Notes
- Some archived notes reference `gpt/plan/*`; treat those mentions as historical and non-canonical.
- If an archived claim conflicts with a canonical doc (`VISION.md`, `PRD.md`, `ROADMAP.md`, `PLAN.md`, `TODO.md`, `STYLE.md`, `TECH-STACK.md`, `TRUST-SAFETY.md`, `DECISIONS.md`), the canonical doc wins.
