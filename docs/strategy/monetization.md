# Monetization — PawsSafe (Draft)

## Principles
- **Donor-first:** never block helping an animal behind a paywall.
- **Transparent:** clearly separate payment processing fees from any platform support.
- **Trust-preserving:** monetization should increase confidence, not reduce it.
- **Clinic-friendly:** clinics are beneficiaries and partners; avoid models that feel extractive.

## Reality check: fees always exist
Even with “0% platform fee”, card/payment processors still charge processing fees. The decision is how PawsSafe covers:
- payment processing fees (passed through vs absorbed),
- operating costs (support, verification, compliance, moderation).

## Options (candidate models)
### A) 0% platform fee + optional “thank you” tip (recommended default)
- Donor sees an optional tip at checkout (or post-donation).
- Pros: aligns with mission; low friction; avoids “taxing donations”.
- Cons: revenue variability; requires great messaging and trust.

### B) 0–1% platform fee + optional tip
- Small platform fee, with optional tip on top.
- Pros: more predictable revenue than tips alone.
- Cons: can feel like taxing donations; messaging needs care.

### C) Sponsorships + matching drives
- CSR partners sponsor campaigns, match donations, or underwrite operating costs.
- Pros: mission-aligned; strong storytelling for investors.
- Cons: longer sales cycle; needs clear brand safety policies.

### D) Optional partner perks (affiliate / marketplace)
- Affiliate links to pet supplies or services; donors get perks.
- Pros: non-intrusive; can be meaningful at scale.
- Cons: needs strict trust controls (no “spammy” marketplace feel).

## What we should avoid (early)
- Charging clinics subscription “plans” as a primary revenue source.
- Complex paywalls that reduce donor trust.
- Anything that makes clinics feel like customers instead of partners.

## Messaging (draft)
“PawsSafe is donor-first: we don’t take a cut of donations. Supporters can optionally add a small ‘thank you’ to help keep the platform running.”

## Decision checkpoints
- Choose default model (A vs B) and set a target revenue per donation.
- Decide if processing fees are passed through or partially absorbed.
- Define how “thank you” is presented: during checkout vs after donation vs in-app supporter badge.

## Next steps
1. Pick the default model to present in investor materials (deck + docs).
2. Add a lightweight “thank you” UX prototype (copy + placement + amounts).
3. Define a trust policy for sponsorships/affiliates (what’s allowed, what’s not).
