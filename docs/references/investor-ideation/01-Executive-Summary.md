## The Opportunity

**Pawtreon** is building the definitive platform for animal welfare — connecting rescuers, verified partners/clinics, donors, and adopters in one seamless experience. When someone finds an injured animal, Pawtreon makes the **best next action obvious and fundable within minutes**.

---

## The Problem

- **€2B+** donated to animal welfare annually, but donations are fragmented across Facebook, GoFundMe, bank transfers
- Rescue posts get buried in social media noise — scammers copy them, donors don't trust them
- Clinics and shelters lack modern tools for verification, updates, and fundraising
- Donors can't easily find verified, trustworthy causes or track their impact

---

## Our Solution

A **trust-first, mobile-first platform** that:
1. **Aggregates** animal rescue cases with verified clinic partnerships and evidence-based updates
2. **Enables** Stripe-powered donations with full transparency (receipts, progress, outcomes)
3. **Builds trust** through a verification ladder (unverified → community → clinic → partner)
4. **Connects** sponsors and corporate partners with high-impact, measurable campaigns
