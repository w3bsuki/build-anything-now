## Elevator Pitch

**Pawtreon** is a trust-first, mobile-first platform that helps people fund emergency care for animals in need. We connect rescuers, verified clinics/partners, and donors so cases get help faster and updates stay transparent.

---

## Key Highlights

- 🎯 **Problem:** Animal rescue is fragmented across Facebook — posts get buried, scammers copy them, donors don't trust them
- 💡 **Solution:** Trust-first platform with verified clinics, transparent cases, and Stripe-powered donations
- 📱 **Product:** Web + iOS + Android (React 19 + Vite 7 + Capacitor)
- 🌍 **Market:** €10B+ global pet care & welfare market
- 💰 **Model:** 5% transaction fee + shelter subscriptions (€49–€199/mo) + sponsored campaigns + corporate giving
- 🚀 **Stage:** MVP sprint in progress — ~60% built, auth + payments + moderation shipped
