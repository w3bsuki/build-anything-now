# Pawtreon Master Plan

- Owner: Human (Decider), OPUS (Executor), Codex (Reviewer)
- Update cadence: Weekly while pre-launch, then bi-weekly
- Last updated: 2026-02-06

## Product Thesis
Pawtreon is a trust-first rescue operating layer for street animals: anyone can start help, verified partners can validate progress, and donors can fund instantly with transparent evidence.

## Founder Source Context (Captured)
This plan is grounded in founder requirements:
- Rescue and fundraising are fragmented across Facebook and low-trust channels.
- Honest helpers without large social followings need a reliable way to raise urgent care funds.
- Cases must support ongoing updates with evidence (photos, bills, clinic details) and lifecycle completion through adoption.
- Clinics/NGOs/volunteers/stores need profile + verification pathways.
- Bulgaria-first operational network is required (clinics, NGOs, shelters, stores, partner onboarding).
- Pawtreon mission initiatives (drones, safehouse/shelter) must be visible and fundable as platform roadmap efforts.

## Product North Star
When someone finds an injured animal, Pawtreon should make the best next action obvious and fundable within minutes.

## Primary Outcomes
1. Faster emergency treatment starts.
2. Higher donor trust via verifiable updates and receipts.
3. More complete rescue loops (street -> treatment -> adoption).
4. Stronger local partner network in Bulgaria.

## Scope Boundaries
### In Scope (Current Cycle)
- Docs system reset with strict canonical governance.
- Trust + money + case lifecycle completion.
- Clinic directory seeding and claim operations.
- Mission campaign surfaces (home + account/profile hub).

### Out of Scope (Current Cycle)
- Drone operations productization.
- Shelter ERP/CRM.
- Messaging-platform rewrite.
- Framework migration away from Vite.

## Core Principles
1. Trust before growth.
2. Mobile-first rescue speed.
3. Human-reviewed high-risk decisions.
4. Evidence-rich transparency.
5. Single account, multi-capability profile.

## Success Metrics
- Time to create case draft (<3 min target).
- Time to first case update after publish.
- Case view -> donation conversion.
- Verification and moderation throughput.
- Claim approval cycle time for partner profiles.
