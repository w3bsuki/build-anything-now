# Pitch Script (10–12 minutes) — Pawtreon

> **Owner:** Founders  
> **Status:** review  
> **Last updated:** 2026-02-09  
> Use this as a talk track while you show `/presentation` + a short live demo.

---

## 1) One-liner (start here)
**Pawtreon** is trust-first emergency care crowdfunding for animals in need — built around verified partners/clinics, transparent updates, and a social feed that consolidates scattered rescue posts into one system of record.

---

## 2) The problem (60–90s)
- Rescue posts are fragmented across Facebook/Instagram, and people miss the urgent ones.
- Donors don't trust what's real → scams and uncertainty reduce giving.
- Clinics and shelters lack a clean workflow for verification, updates, and fundraising.

---

## 3) The wedge (60s)
"See an animal → create a verified case in minutes → donors fund emergency care → clinic posts updates → animal outcome is tracked."

---

## 4) What's live today (show, don't tell)
Demo order:
1. **Home feed** (fast, mobile-first, case-first discovery)
2. Open a **case** (story + progress + structured updates with evidence)
3. Show **donations** (Stripe-powered checkout → receipt → success state)
4. Show **community** (rules + social feel, moderation in place)
5. Show **partners/clinics** (trust infrastructure, claim flow)
6. Show the **Create Case** flow (photos + location + goal → published to Convex)

Deck links (shareable):
- Investor: `/presentation`
- Partner: `/partner`

---

## 5) Why we win (moats)
1. **Verification network** (clinics/partners are the trust layer).
2. **Anti-scam + transparency** (verification status, evidence, reporting, moderation queue + audit logging).
3. **Social consolidation** (import/link external posts so rescues stop getting lost).
4. **Mission initiatives** (drone program, safehouse — platform-level campaigns that show the long-term vision).

---

## 6) What we'll build next (the exciting part)
### AI-assisted listings (speed + safety)
- "List with AI": photo → AI draft → user review → publish (human-in-loop). UI scaffolding exists — server-side extraction is Phase 3.
- "Need help now": triage + safe, non-diagnostic guidance with escalation.

### Volunteer logistics (real-world impact)
- Availability map (transport, fostering, rescue ops)
- Request help → match nearby volunteers

---

## 7) Business model (mission-aligned, 4 revenue streams)
1. **5% transaction fee** on all donations (Stripe powered)
2. **Shelter subscriptions** — €49–€199/mo for analytics, priority support, reduced fees
3. **Sponsored campaigns** — €500–€50K for brand CSR visibility with measurable impact
4. **Corporate giving** — Employee matching programs, branded campaigns (Year 2+)

Free tier includes all core features. Monetization layers on top — we never gate rescue outcomes.

---

## 8) The ask (30–45s)
State:
- [FILL: Amount raising — e.g., €150,000]
- [FILL: Runway + milestones it unlocks — e.g., 18 months to profitability, EU expansion]
- What you want from the investor besides money (distribution, pet industry connections, EU regulatory expertise)

---

## 9) Anticipated questions (quick answers)
- **Vite vs Next.js?** Keep Vite for app + Capacitor; add SSR share pages for OG/SEO (no rewrite).
- **Scams?** Verification ladder + evidence-based updates + risk scoring + moderation queue with audit logging. Donations can be gated by verification status.
- **Medical liability?** "Need help" is non-diagnostic guidance with clear escalation + safety constraints.
- **Why Bulgaria first?** High stray population, active rescue community fragmented across Facebook groups, EU payment infrastructure, lower CAC for validation.
- **Revenue?** 5% fee is competitive with JustGiving, better tools than Facebook (0% but no features). Shelter subscriptions add recurring B2B revenue.
