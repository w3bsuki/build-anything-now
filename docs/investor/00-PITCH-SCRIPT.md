# Pitch Script (10–12 minutes) — Pawtreon

> Use this as a talk track while you show `/presentation` + a short live demo.

---

## 1) One-liner (start here)
**Pawtreon** is trust-first emergency care crowdfunding for animals in need — built around verified partners/clinics, transparent updates, and a social feed that consolidates scattered rescue posts into one system of record.

---

## 2) The problem (60–90s)
- Rescue posts are fragmented across Facebook/Instagram, and people miss the urgent ones.
- Donors don’t trust what’s real → scams and uncertainty reduce giving.
- Clinics and shelters lack a clean workflow for verification, updates, and fundraising.

---

## 3) The wedge (60s)
“See an animal → create a verified case in minutes → donors fund emergency care → clinic posts updates → animal outcome is tracked.”

---

## 4) What’s live today (show, don’t tell)
Demo order:
1. **Home feed** (fast, mobile-first)
2. Open a **case** (story + progress + updates)
3. Show **community** (rules + social feel)
4. Show **partners/clinics** (trust infrastructure)
5. Optional: show the **Create** flow (don’t click broken paths)

Deck links (shareable):
- Investor: `/presentation`
- Partner: `/partner`

---

## 5) Why we win (moats)
1. **Verification network** (clinics/partners are the trust layer).
2. **Anti-scam + transparency** (verification status, evidence, reporting, moderation).
3. **Social consolidation** (import/link external posts so rescues stop getting lost).

---

## 6) What we’ll build next (the exciting part)
### AI-assisted listings (speed + safety)
- “List with AI”: photo → AI draft → user review → publish (human-in-loop).
- “Need help now”: triage + safe, non-diagnostic guidance with escalation.

### Volunteer logistics (real-world impact)
- Availability map (transport, fostering, rescue ops)
- Request help → match nearby volunteers

---

## 7) Business model (keep it mission-aligned)
- Donor-first (optional tips / platform sponsorship)
- Partner/CSR sponsorships (case matching, campaigns)
- Pro tooling for shelters/partners (later, only after trust + traction)

---

## 8) The ask (30–45s)
State:
- Amount raising
- Runway + milestones it unlocks (MVP launch + verification + payments + native apps)
- What you want from the investor besides money (distribution, partnerships, ops)

---

## 9) Anticipated questions (quick answers)
- **Vite vs Next.js?** Keep Vite for app + Capacitor; add SSR share pages for OG/SEO (no rewrite).
- **Scams?** Verification ladder + evidence + risk scoring + moderation; donations can be gated by verification.
- **Medical liability?** “Need help” is non-diagnostic guidance with clear escalation + safety constraints.
