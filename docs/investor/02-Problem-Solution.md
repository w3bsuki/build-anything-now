## The Problem

### For Animal Shelters 🏠

|------------|--------|
| **Fragmented fundraising** | Using 5+ tools (GoFundMe, Facebook, PayPal, bank transfers) |
| **No visibility** | Lost in social media noise, can't reach donors |
| **Manual processes** | Paper adoption forms, spreadsheet tracking |
| **Limited reach** | Only local community knows about them |
| **Trust issues** | Hard to prove legitimacy to new donors |

### For Donors 💝

| Pain Point | Impact |
|------------|--------|
| **Can't find causes** | No central place to discover rescue cases |
| **Trust concerns** | "Will my money actually help?" |
| **No transparency** | Donate and never hear back |
| **Friction** | Every shelter has different payment methods |
| **No impact tracking** | Can't see what their donations achieved |

### For Adopters 🐕

| Pain Point | Impact |
|------------|--------|
| **Discovery problem** | Have to visit multiple shelter websites |
| **Outdated listings** | Pets already adopted still showing |
| **Complex process** | Paper forms, phone calls, visits |
| **No matching** | Can't filter by lifestyle/preferences |

## The Current Landscape

```
Shelter A → Facebook + GoFundMe + Bank Transfer
Shelter B → Instagram + PayPal + Paper forms
Shelter C → Website + Stripe + Spreadsheets
Shelter D → Word of mouth only

        ↓ Result ↓

😫 Donors confused, can't find verified causes
😫 Shelters competing instead of collaborating
😫 Animals waiting longer for help
