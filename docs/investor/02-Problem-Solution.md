## The Problem

### For Rescuers & Animal Finders 🆘

| Pain Point | Impact |
|------------|--------|
| **Posts get buried** | Urgent rescue posts lost in Facebook/Instagram feeds within hours |
| **Scammers copy posts** | Fake accounts repost real cases to collect donations |
| **No structured workflow** | No way to track case progress, updates, or outcomes |
| **Fragmented fundraising** | Using 5+ tools (GoFundMe, Facebook, PayPal, bank transfers) |
| **Trust gap** | Donors hesitate because they can't verify legitimacy |

### For Donors 💝

| Pain Point | Impact |
|------------|--------|
| **Can't find causes** | No central place to discover verified rescue cases |
| **Trust concerns** | "Will my money actually help this animal?" |
| **No transparency** | Donate and never hear back about the outcome |
| **Friction** | Every shelter has different payment methods |
| **No impact tracking** | Can't see what their donations achieved |

### For Clinics & Shelters 🏥

| Pain Point | Impact |
|------------|--------|
| **No visibility** | Only local community knows about their work |
| **Manual processes** | Spreadsheet tracking, paper forms, phone calls |
| **Limited reach** | Can't connect with donors beyond their city |
| **Verification burden** | Hard to prove legitimacy to new donors |
| **No fundraising tools** | Rely on social media posts with no analytics |

## The Current Landscape

```
Rescuer A → Facebook post + bank transfer link
Rescuer B → Instagram story + PayPal.me
Shelter C → Website + GoFundMe + Stripe
Shelter D → Word of mouth only

        ↓ Result ↓

😫 Donors confused — can't verify which cases are real
😫 Rescuers competing for attention instead of collaborating
😫 Animals waiting longer for help
😫 No system of record — outcomes are never tracked
```

## Key Differentiators

### 1. **Trust Engine (Verification Ladder)**
Cases and clinics go through a verification ladder: unverified → community-endorsed → clinic-verified → partner-verified. Donors see verification status on every surface.

### 2. **Case-Based Donations with Evidence**
Donate to specific animals, not just organizations. Every update can include evidence (vet bills, lab results, clinic photos) — donors see exactly where money goes.

### 3. **Structured Outcomes Tracking**
Every case has a lifecycle with tracked outcomes. Cases don't just disappear — they close with documented results (success, transferred, other).

### 4. **Moderation + Anti-Scam**
Report queue with admin review, audit logging, risk scoring, and donation gating on unverified/high-risk cases. Not just reactive — proactive trust.

### 5. **Mobile-First, Multi-Language**
Built for modern users on mobile. Supporting Bulgarian, English, German, Russian, Ukrainian from day one. Bulgaria launch, EU expansion.

### 6. **Mission Initiatives**
Beyond individual cases: platform-level campaigns (drone rescue program, safehouse & adoption center) that show the long-term vision of the movement.

## Projected Success Stories (Pre-Launch)

> *These are projected outcomes based on our platform model. Real stories will replace these as we launch.*

> "Before Pawtreon, our rescue posts reached maybe 200 people on Facebook. Now every case gets funded within 48 hours and donors get updates every step of the way."
> — *Future clinic partner*

> "I donated €20 and got weekly updates with photos and vet bills. I know exactly how I helped save Max. I've since donated to 5 more cases."
> — *Future donor*
